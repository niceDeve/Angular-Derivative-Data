Angular: Working with Derivative Data using RxJS

• Collecting data from a backend server 
• Combining data stream with other data streams to handle foreign key and aggregate relationships 
• Caching the streams in a service so they can be readily reused 
• Producing user - friendly data for display 
• All without a subscription
